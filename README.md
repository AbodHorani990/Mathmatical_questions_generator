# Mathmatical_questions_generator
A C++ console-based math exam program that generates random arithmetic questions with multiple difficulty levels, provides instant feedback using colors, and demonstrates clean function-based design, enums, and random number generation.

Math Exam Program is a C++ console-based application that simulates a simple math exam.
The program generates random math questions based on a selected difficulty level and evaluates the user’s answers in real time.

This project focuses on logic building, clean function design, and basic game-style interaction using colors and randomness.
